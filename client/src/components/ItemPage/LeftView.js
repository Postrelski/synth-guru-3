      <p>
        Inspired by the sounds of artists like Kaytranada, Disclosure, Pomo,
        FKJ, Jerry Folk & more, SOULECT for Serum is a high quality collection
        of presets for soulful electronic music. A versatile collection of Keys,
        Pads, Bass and Leads are included and are a modern interpretation of
        vintage analog and digital synths & keyboards from the 80's and 90's.
        Perfect for production in a variety of genres such as R&B, Soul, Hip
        Hop, House & Pop these presets make use of my own custom made wavetables
        which sample real instruments, analog synths & samplers. Each preset
        comes with all 4 macros preassigned to key parameters, giving you lots
        of easy control over the sound and the ability to tweak the sound to fit
        your own needs.
